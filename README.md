### Implementation of TCP low priority in ns-3:
TCP Low priority is a TCP variant for low priority data transfer in which the low priority data utilises only excess bandwidth.
Test cases are written to validate the working of the algorithm. Examples are also written.The code is submitted for review
to be merged into ns-3.

Implementation of Explicit Loss Notification in ns-3(ongoing):
Explicit Loss Notification (ELN) is a mechanism which explains whether the loss of a packet is unrelated to network
congestion to the sender.
Implementation of Stabilized RED in ns-3:
Stabilized RED is an Active Queue Management which proactively drops the packets using a load-dependent probability. It
stabilizes the buffer occupation independent of the number of active connections.Test cases are written to validate the
code.
Implementation of CHOKe in ns-3:
CHOKe (CHOose and Keep for responsive flows, CHOose and Kill for unresponsive flows) is an Active Queue
Management algorithm that punishes flows which send more packets than their fair share to a router.Test cases are
written to validate the code.
Implementation of Modified Canny Edge detection algorithm
Implemented the paper "An Improved Canny Edge Detection Algorithm" which details about a modification of Canny edge
detection algorithm to reduce the sensitivity of Edge detection algorithm to noise and to preserve weak edge information
